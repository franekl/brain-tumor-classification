In this project, we aim to address the problem outlined by leveraging image processing and pattern recognition techniques to produce automated detection and classification of brain tumours from MRI scans. By creating a more efficient process for the preliminary analysis of a brain image, medical professionals will be better able to make decisions for their patients. Medical professionals will be able to use the results from our model to accurately determine what measures are needed to further substantiate the diagnosis, such as performing a biopsy, and what treatment options will be most suitable for the patient.

The data we used to develop our project is the publicly available ‘Brain Tumor MRI Dataset’, which contains 7022 images of MRI brain scans that are split into four classes (Nickparvar, 2021). The classes are: glioma (1621 images), meningioma (1645 images), pituitary (1757 images) and no tumour (2000 images). The dataset is a combination of three widely downloaded and cited datasets: figshare, SARTAJ and Br35H, and has been validated by numerous studies (see Abdusalomov et al., 2023). In order to improve the generalisability of the model, we used data augmentation strategies to diversify our training samples.
